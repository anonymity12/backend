# random select a card for each month

at first this is my thoughts, which is: when a month start, I give the user one card(of course, a card belong to his/her style/series)
and we do need a random select algorithm to choose the card.

but later I realized that, in real game, we can have many card we want, as long as we buy it, then we refine it, then we 
sold it.

so here is my new thought: 
1) users can buy the card at shop at arbitrary time
2) after he/she buy the card, the card goes to his/her card cabinet
3) the card cabinet contains all cards user own
4) the one card is being refining is paint will light edge, others are just normal card form
5) when user click one card, here is a dialog(button1: select: user can set this as primary refining card; button2: sold)
6) maybe we can make a card plaza(users buy and sold their card)

so based on the new thought 0819, I think that: we need a center shop.
shop has many series card, aka many template card.

so in the extra area, we will add a button, like `shop`, which will lead the users to the shop page.
here in the shop, users buy the card they like.
but here is the question: younger user will feel confuse that there are too many card, which one should I choose?
so at the beginning, I think that: we provide a few cards
a few cards means: we provide 4 cards, 4 butterfly picture(gif would be cool)
then after our app iteration, we may provide more cards, like tanjianci, like shanhaijing

so as summary, shop now provide four card(at the basic level), then in the future iteration, shop will provide more card
(at the advance level)

but this is not personal enough, since I can customize each user's app icon, I can customize his/her card series too
for example, user yy can have dancer card, user xx can have toy card, user sc can have stone card, user xh can have sichuanFood card,
user ll can have babe-face card.

so as another summary, shop should provide one series card for one user, so how do we choose the series? we bind the series
to the user.

so the above two plans can come to one plan, we bind basic series(butterfly) to every user, and then, we bind personal series
to specific user.

so we define a new table: user_card_series_tbl

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `user_card_series_tbl` (
    `userId` int(11) NOT NULL comment 'relation left arrow to user',
    `seriesId` int(11) NOT NULL comment 'relation right arrow to card series',
    PRIMARY KEY (`userId`)
) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8mb4;
```
